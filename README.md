This repository contains some POCS I wrote during the years...

There is a POC about business oriented test writing (to write dev friendly and human readable tests) : [[Test writer POC](testcase-writer)]

![TC WriterCode2](screenshots/TC_Writer_code2.png)

This POC is also used to test a MVC POC (to simplify the writing of complex GUIs) : [[MVC POC](skylib-java)]
