This repository contains some POCS I wrote during the years...

There is a POC about business oriented test writing (to write java friendly and human readable tests) : [[Test writer](testcase-writer)]

This POC is also used to test a MVC POC (to simplify the writing of complex GUIs) : [[Test writer](skylib-java)]
