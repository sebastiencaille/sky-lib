# The Backend
The backend is a SpringBoot web application that can be started using ch.scaille.tcwriter.server.Server

The class ch.scaille.tcwriter.server.bootstrap.ExampleBootstrap (in webabpptests) can be used to create an initial configuration.

# Versioned apis
To create a new version of the apis:
 * copy the folder api-v0, i.e. into api-v1
 * in the api-v1 folder, use "sed -i 's/v0/v1/' `find . -type f`"
 * edit the pom.xml to change the property apiVersion to 1
 * include the artifact testcase-writer-webapp-api-v0-backend in the backend module
 * edit the package.json to use the new api version
